# mock_da_dev_setup README

Make sure that you have not installed the mock debug extension before continuing. In case you do, `uninstall` it.

## Instructions
* Now, press `F5` in this extension development host. Let's debug the DA!!! Remember, If you have started the extension development host by launching the base vscode as server, then you can debug the debugger by putting break points inside debugger code i,e, `mockDebug.ts`. If not, you can just debug the `extension.ts`.
